## Active Work

- Phase: Pre-Phase 4 — Migration Readiness
- Milestone: exhaustive migration census and boundary classification
- State: census documented and classifications approved; awaiting commit authorization; Phase 4 has not started

## Why the Plan Was Reset

The prior sequence built an evidence/reporting foundation, completed a Bookmarking/Downloads vertical slice, and then
began migrating production capabilities one group at a time. General feature discovery, relationship evaluation,
specialized obligations, contract selection, and projections were deferred.

That sequence produced an uncommitted hardcoded completion contract for Open, Continue, Bookmarking, Downloads, and Bulk
Downloads. It also repeated provider registrations as per-type capability assertions. Both mechanisms required a future
contributor to remember another list and therefore contradicted the manifesto. The contract and duplicate assertions were
removed rather than expanded.

The corrected rule is architecture first, production conformance second. Intermediate compile failures are acceptable
when new boundaries expose unported code. Compilation must be restored by migrating that code, not by adding a parallel
authority or weakening the architecture.

## Durable Decisions

- Content types and features contribute through owned, discoverable boundaries.
- A content type is valid with any subset of interaction providers; no interaction, including Open or Continue, is
  mandatory for architectural validity.
- Provider presence proves support and provider absence means unsupported without a separate absence declaration.
- Features own prerequisites, contextual inputs, shared consequences, specialized obligations, behavioral contracts,
  and projections.
- Generic assembly and evaluation contain no concrete type, capability, or feature allowlist.
- Tests verify architecture mechanics, shared behavior, and genuine media behavior; they do not restate declarations.
- The retired report and the retained Bookmarking/Downloads behavior are migration evidence, not protected architecture.

## New Phase Sequence

- Phase 3: General relationship architecture
- Phase 4: Entry-type composition migration
- Phase 5: Feature integration migration
- Phase 6: Contextual and external integration
- Phase 7: Graph-selected contracts, reporting, and documentation
- Phase 8: Legacy removal, boundary enforcement, and build completion

Phase 3 milestones:

- 3.1: Contribution semantics and ownership
- 3.2: Discovery and graph assembly
- 3.3: Evaluation and obligations
- 3.4: Contract and projection selection
- 3.5: Dependency boundary and migration cut

No Manga, Anime, Book, Bookmarking, Downloads, or other product-specific branch may enter the generic Phase 3 kernel.
The phase uses anonymous synthetic contributions to prove unknown future participation.

Milestone 3.5 removed `EntryCapabilityCatalog`, `EntryCapabilityReport`, `supportsTypeWide`, legacy report assembly,
explicit absence compensation, and production report DI exposure rather than deprecating them behind a working facade.
Unported consumers now fail to compile and are recorded in `migration-obligations.md`. The old report does not survive
beside the graph.

## Current Working Tree Scope

- `entry-interactions:api` exports the lower-level `feature-graph` contract.
- Entry-type plugins must be owned graph contributors as well as operational registrars; no default or lambda
  compatibility contribution exists.
- Independent feature contributors remain separate composition inputs and are not forced through entry-type plugins.
- Entry-interaction composition now discovers, assembles, evaluates, and selects the graph and exposes all three results
  through runtime DI beside operational interactions.
- The catalog, legacy evidence/support model, report, `supportsTypeWide`, report assembly, report-driven download policy,
  report DI binding, and authority-focused unit tests are deleted.
- Anime and Book no longer declare explicit unsupported outcomes for missing providers.
- Remaining production/test references are owned in `migration-obligations.md`; they are compile failures rather than a
  working fallback authority.
- A complete anonymous acceptance test proves future complete, incomplete, and partial types through unchanged discovery,
  evaluation, consequence, obligation, contract, and projection paths.
- Accepted decision `0011-production-boundary-cut.md` and Phase 3.5 completion notes.
- Uncommitted migration-readiness documentation only; no Phase 4 production migration has started.

## Pre-Phase 4 Census Findings

The interaction registry is not the complete participation boundary. The census found systems that can currently be
forgotten even when an interaction provider is added:

- a separate required-per-type library-progress calculator registry;
- parallel root lists for type plugins, runtime installers, warmups, viewer settings, media caches, and image components;
- viewer-setting provider discovery followed by a hardcoded provider-to-screen and settings-search map;
- media-cache providers followed by hardcoded keys, labels, launch auto-clear preferences, and startup wiring;
- manually enumerated profile preference ownership and legacy profile-key correction;
- source SDK capabilities with independently reconstructed consumers across browse, entry, feed, update, migration,
  download, and WebView behavior;
- tracker type applicability and tracker sub-capabilities with entry, library, sync, and dialog consequences;
- direct capability gates in backup, restore, migration, library-update notification routing, presentation, and settings;
- boundary-check allowlists that require another edit for each concrete type bridge; and
- curated settings navigation/search lists that can omit a contributed capability surface.

The complete proposed dispositions are in `migration-inventory.md`. The ledger also records the interaction-provider
sub-capabilities that would otherwise be lost by a mechanical processor migration, including download options/settings,
bulk pools, automatic filtering, migration/merge, child progress labels, child-group behavior, and library filters.

## Approved Boundary Classifications

Approved on 2026-07-18:

- All listed out-of-boundary systems participate in the application-wide graph through their real owners.
- Book's internal format-processor registry remains an internal media boundary unless a processor exposes a
  cross-feature consequence.
- Global non-feature settings navigation may remain curated; capability-owned settings screens and search participation
  must be contributed and selected.

## Last Validation

- `./gradlew --quiet spotlessApply :feature-graph:testDebugUnitTest :entry-interactions:api:compileDebugKotlin` passed.
- The complete synthetic test covers automatic future participation, shared artifact identity, missing specialized
  obligations, and a valid partial type without production vocabulary.
- `:entry-interactions:spi:compileDebugKotlin` fails at the deleted report-based download policy, as recorded in
  `migration-obligations.md`.
- Search confirms no legacy catalog/report definition, explicit unsupported outcome, or production report DI binding
  remains.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- The pre-Phase 4 census inspected interaction processors and defaults, all production `EntryType` references in the
  audited app/domain/data/source/interaction modules, direct current-type branches, source API capability contracts,
  tracker capabilities, root composition, settings, notifications, backup/migration, profile ownership, caches, tests,
  documentation, and boundary enforcement.
- Census snapshot: 14 interaction processor categories, 76 production files with `EntryType` in the audited modules, 20
  production files outside type modules with direct current-type constants, 214 audited production/test and
  boundary-build-logic files with `EntryType`, one separate type-provider registry for library progress, and 16 source
  capability contracts or capability-bearing contracts.
- `git diff --check` passes for the migration-readiness documentation.

## Manifesto Comparison

- The hardcoded capability list was removed, not repaired.
- The revised plan builds generic discovery, relationships, obligations, contracts, and projections before more consumer
  migration.
- The old catalog/report authority is retired at the Phase 3.5 boundary cut, not deferred until final cleanup.
- All interactions are provider-backed; current ubiquity does not make an operation mandatory for future types.
- A missing provider creates no obligation. Obligations begin only after a feature's declared prerequisites are
  satisfied.
- Tests no longer repeat current provider facts as completeness declarations.
- The decisive Phase 3 proof uses unknown synthetic contributions and rejects concrete product branches.
- Phase 3.1 uses actual provider and executable artifact objects rather than building another descriptive support report.
- The new kernel does not depend on or preserve the old catalog/report API.
- Contributor installation is an environment concern; the graph kernel contains no concrete contributor registry.
- Every supplied provider must connect to a feature-owned relationship, preventing capabilities from silently bypassing
  the consequence graph.
- Assembly records relationships without prematurely evaluating support or obligations.
- Evaluation applies every discovered relationship without a product matrix or feature-specific branch.
- Missing prerequisites remain ordinary unsupported behavior; only missing specialized work after applicability creates
  an obligation.
- Context is retained as conditional instead of being guessed or flattened into type-wide support.
- Per-type applicability edges reference one feature-owned shared consequence, preserving single-gate coordinators.
- Contracts and projections are selected from the same applicable relationships without another support matrix.
- Fixture obligations are type-owned only when a contract declares genuine media-specific validation input.
- Missing shared projections are feature-owned and aggregated across affected subjects instead of duplicated per type.
- No contract, fixture, or projection kind is globally mandatory.
- The old catalog/report authority was deleted rather than wrapped or deprecated.
- Type plugins and independent feature contributors meet only at environment composition; neither side enumerates the
  other.
- No empty type contribution or feature-contributor fallback hides unported work.
- Known compile failures are mapped to Phases 4, 5, and 7 with responsible owners.
- The lower generic and provider-contract boundaries compile even though production does not.
- Compilation pressure cannot justify dual authorities or fallback architecture.
- The full architecture is app-wide and not limited to Bookmarking or Downloads.
- Migration readiness no longer equates “all interaction processors found” with “all participation found.”
- Already-generic call sites remain in the migration register because generic code can still sit outside graph-selected
  ownership and be forgotten by a future contribution.
- Settings, workers, notifications, navigation, backup, migration, profile preferences, caches, external capabilities,
  tests, and documentation are explicit feature consequences rather than a later informal audit.
- The migration inventory is a temporary control surface with completion dispositions, not a new runtime allowlist or
  capability authority.

## Exact Next Action After Review

Commit this migration-readiness milestone only when explicitly authorized. Do not start Phase 4 in the same milestone.
A later, separate authorization may start the first bounded `T01`–`T27` Phase 4 milestone; do not migrate feature
consumers.
